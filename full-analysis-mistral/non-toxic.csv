"Man o man, what has our media become, and who hires these writers, for lack of a better word.

Starting an article with stating such an alarming problem, without any proof or context, just IT IS believe me...and then going on to lecture what should be done...

What happen to just reporting the ACTUALLY, FACTUAL news as it was happening in reality...

Why Hype and make everything so Alarming..?

Can not wait for media to regain a level of professionalism again...

Hire some writers with integrity instead of many fancy degrees from gender studies classes...",Non-Toxic

"ICE chief's statement says its annual budget will be $7.9 billion, including ""$4.9 billion to expand detention capacity."" Do we really want to pay that much money to detain people, most of them productive members of society who start businesses, pick our crops, mow our lawns, etc.? What happened to small government?",Non-Toxic
"You are free to believe what you like. However there is a burden of rationality inherent in conversation particularly public ones. Advancing arguments of a god should require that you engage with the following:

1. Posit a set of axioms that exclude sought proof.
2. Define god. 
3. Define existence. 
4. Show objective evidence that a god meets that criteria.
5. Show that the result is significant! 

IMO.  Morality, just like god is likely a construct. It is an very important one, but a construct none the less. Arguments that rely on the most good, or the absoluteness of good are flawed. Humans certainly do not seem to be divine or special in any sense. It seems likely that we are simply cleverer animals. The initial formation of the universe is outside the boundaries of concrete knowledge. However the formation of the universe while including randomness, is not random.",Non-Toxic
Exactly.  I was just reading a story about how Ed Norton made a fraction of what Brad Pitt did in Fight club.  Equal parts.  Equal face time doesn't warrant equal pay.  Their greed about what OTHERS were making will now undermine their whole bottom line.  Smart.,Non-Toxic
"The Texans seem to have grit which is certainly lacking these days among those who would prefer to see them all suffering. The fact that the Federal folks were well organized and working well with the state and local folks must be driving those of you who want this to be more of a disaster so you can pin it on Trump. People should be marveling as I am at how all those folks are reaching out to help one another no matter skin color, flags, or political bent.
I can't get over the people who want to see this turn into a worse disaster then it is just so they can crow about Texas getting what it deserved or how Tump failed. So far, people are co no together and helping each other.",Non-Toxic

"You did not, or can not, read my comment.  So how about having a literate friend read it to you?

Despite what Sean Hannity said, the investigation staff is still being hired, so it's idiotic to already expect results.

None of the investigations underway have released any kind of report.  Nothing.  So you might consider rethinking your confidence that nothing will be found.",Non-Toxic
"So, they're saying that non-white people are the same, and just any old""PoC"" will do? ""Your beliefs, experiences and opinions don't matter, we just need to tick off your colour on our rainbow chart. Oh, would you mind posing for a photo?"" I would have thought institutions of learning would prize diversity of thought over anything else (""black people all think the same, just make sure we've got a couple to show off"")

...and do they realize they're all chasing the same very small pool of candidates? Look, I know they don't mean East Asians when they say diversity (they're honorary white people because they're successful despite all this white supremacy), so that leaves about 10 % of the total population of Canadians. And that's just raw numbers, not filtering for age, accreditation, geography, etc. Black Canadians are about 3% of the total population. It's simple math, all of our universities will not be able to be as diverse as they want to be.",Non-Toxic

"If the media had had its way, Donald Trump wouldn't have been invited to a single deabate....until they discovered the difference in their ratings when he was there and when he wasn't.
