# Real-Time Content Moderation System: 
# A Statistical Evaluation of LLM-Based Toxicity Detection

## Abstract

This dissertation presents a comprehensive statistical evaluation of a real-time content moderation system designed for streaming chat applications. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect and filter toxic content in online conversations. Using the SetFit/toxic_conversations dataset as a benchmark, we conduct a rigorous statistical analysis to assess the system's performance, reliability, and efficiency. Our evaluation includes accuracy metrics, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, ROC analysis, and detailed error analysis. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based moderation in identifying toxic content with high accuracy while maintaining acceptable latency for real-time applications. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on content moderation technologies and provides insights for future improvements in automated toxicity detection systems.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Online platforms face increasing challenges in moderating user-generated content at scale. Traditional keyword-based filtering systems lack the contextual understanding necessary to accurately identify subtle forms of toxicity, while human moderation cannot scale to meet the demands of real-time communication platforms. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution by combining contextual understanding with scalable automation.

This dissertation evaluates a comprehensive real-time moderation system that integrates LLMs with lightweight preprocessing filters to efficiently detect toxic content in streaming chat applications. The system is designed to balance accuracy, latency, and cost-effectivenessâ€”three critical factors for practical deployment in production environments.

### 1.2 Research Questions

This study addresses the following research questions:

1. How effective is the LLM-based moderation system in identifying toxic content compared to traditional approaches?
2. What statistical confidence can we place in the system's performance metrics?
3. How does message length and content complexity affect moderation latency?
4. What types of toxic content are most reliably detected, and where does the system struggle?
5. How can statistical analysis inform future improvements to the moderation pipeline?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Content Moderation Approaches

Content moderation systems have evolved significantly over the past decade. Early approaches relied primarily on keyword filtering and regular expressions to identify problematic content (Gillespie, 2018). While computationally efficient, these methods suffered from high false positive rates and could be easily circumvented through creative spelling or coded language (Chandrasekharan et al., 2017).

More sophisticated approaches incorporated machine learning classifiers trained on labeled datasets (Davidson et al., 2017). These systems improved detection accuracy but still struggled with context-dependent toxicity and emerging forms of harmful content (Fortuna & Nunes, 2018).

Recent advances in natural language processing, particularly the development of large language models, have enabled more nuanced content analysis (Gehman et al., 2020). These models can better understand context, detect implicit toxicity, and adapt to evolving patterns of harmful communication (Pavlopoulos et al., 2020).

### 2.2 Large Language Models for Content Moderation

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. Models like GPT-4, PaLM, and DeepSeek have achieved near-human performance on various natural language understanding tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022).

Several studies have explored the application of LLMs to content moderation tasks. Gehman et al. (2020) evaluated the toxicity of text generated by language models and proposed methods for reducing harmful outputs. Pavlopoulos et al. (2020) investigated the effectiveness of transformer-based models in detecting toxic comments and found they outperformed traditional machine learning approaches.

However, deploying LLMs for real-time content moderation presents significant challenges. These models are computationally intensive, leading to high latency and operational costs at scale (Bommasani et al., 2021). Additionally, LLMs may exhibit biases present in their training data, potentially leading to inconsistent moderation decisions across different demographic groups or cultural contexts (Blodgett et al., 2020).

### 2.3 Hybrid Moderation Systems

To address the limitations of pure LLM-based approaches, researchers have proposed hybrid systems that combine lightweight preprocessing with more sophisticated models. Chandrasekharan et al. (2019) demonstrated that a multi-stage filtering approach could significantly reduce computational requirements while maintaining high accuracy.

Lightweight filters can quickly process the majority of content, allowing more resource-intensive models to focus on ambiguous or borderline cases (Risch & Krestel, 2020). This approach aligns with the "triage" concept in content moderation, where different types of content receive different levels of scrutiny based on risk assessment (Gillespie, 2020).

Our research builds on these hybrid approaches by implementing and evaluating a two-stage moderation system that combines lightweight preprocessing with LLM-based analysis. We extend previous work by conducting a rigorous statistical evaluation of system performance and analyzing the factors that influence moderation accuracy and efficiency.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Overview of the Moderation System

The real-time moderation system evaluated in this dissertation consists of several interconnected components designed to efficiently process and analyze chat messages for toxic content. The system follows a modular architecture that enables scalability, reliability, and continuous improvement.

The core components include:

1. **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server that handles LLM interactions
2. **Lightweight Filter**: Fast preprocessing component that reduces LLM costs
3. **Decision Handler**: Policy enforcement and action execution module
4. **Metrics Evaluator**: Monitoring and evaluation component

### 3.2 Moderation Pipeline

When a message enters the system, it follows a defined processing pipeline:

1. **Initial Reception**: The message is received and validated.
2. **Lightweight Filtering**: A computationally efficient filter performs initial screening to identify obviously benign or obviously toxic content.
3. **LLM Analysis**: Messages that pass the lightweight filter are analyzed by the DeepSeek LLM to detect nuanced forms of toxicity.
4. **Decision Making**: Based on the LLM analysis, the system determines whether to allow, flag, or block the message.
5. **Action Execution**: The appropriate action is taken (e.g., allowing the message, sending a warning, blocking the user).
6. **Metrics Collection**: Performance data is collected for monitoring and improvement.

### 3.3 Integration with DeepSeek LLM

The system integrates with DeepSeek LLM, which provides the contextual understanding necessary for accurate toxicity detection. The integration is managed through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that handles prompt engineering, response parsing, and error handling.

The LLM is configured with specific parameters to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and latency:

- **Temperature**: 0.1 (to ensure consistent, deterministic outputs)
- **Max Tokens**: 50 (sufficient for moderation decisions without unnecessary computation)
- **Model**: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (selected for balance of performance and efficiency)

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Dataset

This study utilizes the SetFit/toxic_conversations dataset from Hugging Face, which contains labeled examples of toxic and non-toxic online conversations. For our evaluation, we selected a balanced subset of 40 samples (20 toxic, 20 non-toxic) to ensure equal representation of both classes.

The dataset was preprocessed to remove any identifying information and formatted for compatibility with our moderation system. Each entry consists of a text message and a binary label indicating whether the message is toxic (1) or non-toxic (0).

### 4.2 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the moderation system using the following metrics:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified messages.
2. **Precision**: The proportion of messages classified as toxic that are actually toxic.
3. **Recall**: The proportion of actually toxic messages that are correctly classified as toxic.
4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
5. **ROC AUC**: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, measuring discrimination ability.
6. **PR AUC**: Area under the Precision-Recall curve, particularly useful for imbalanced datasets.
7. **Latency**: Time taken to process and classify each message.

### 4.3 Statistical Analysis Methods

Our statistical analysis includes:

1. **Confidence Intervals**: Bootstrap and parametric methods to estimate 95% confidence intervals for key metrics.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical tests to determine if the system performs significantly better than random chance.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between message characteristics and system performance.
4. **ROC Analysis**: Evaluating the system's discrimination ability across different threshold settings.
5. **Error Analysis**: Detailed examination of false positives and false negatives.

### 4.4 Experimental Setup

The experiments were conducted in a controlled environment with the following setup:

- **Hardware**: Standard cloud-based virtual machine with 4 vCPUs and 16GB RAM
- **Software**: Python 3.9 with scikit-learn, SciPy, and Matplotlib libraries
- **Network**: Stable connection to the DeepSeek LLM endpoint with <100ms latency
- **Testing Procedure**: Each message was processed through the complete moderation pipeline, with results and timing information recorded for analysis

For reproducibility, all random seeds were fixed, and the same dataset split was used across all experiments.
