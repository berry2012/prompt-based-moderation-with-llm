Could we actually get bipartisan support or is it a pipe dream. \n\nAdditionally, the idea of a high speed transit in the windsor to toronto, and maybe in the future toronto to montreal corridors (which is like half of Canada's population) is one that may be interesting. There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. \n\nAlso, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing \"NIMBY\" BS. Not to mention it would be a great selling point of \"hey, look at our futuresque shit that travels at speeds that rival planes\".",
