I guess the Ontario liberals and Alberta ndp share stupid ideas.,1
"The German government, apparently,  puts the number of German citizens killed in the terrible disruption after WWII at 2 to 2.5 million. Other estimates are lower . . . as much as 2/3's lower. Is it really your contention that they were all massacred by Jews? 

Did they teach you this pestiferous crap at Stanford? You should ask for your money back. !",1
And i moved here 46 years ago to get away from feminazis.,1
"Hypocrisy!.
Ditto for Morneau and his many financial tentacles.
Hypocrites!",1
"His whole family were lying killers. He is a lying killer with no moral compass.  His lawyer coached this garbage. You are an idiot to believe this ""thing""  should be  allowed in Canada.  He is no child!!!",1
"rangerMC,  you dont even make sense anymore. when will you thumpers realize that lgbtq's,  blacks, muslims, mexicans, asians, the poor, the homeless, aliens, extraterrestrial and earth bound, all have the same, inalienable rights as you, white, christian males do (in a just world of course), the right of personal choice. no one says a straight guy cant marry a straight woman. we just dont care because it is none of our business. its not about your beliefs or your ideology, its about equality and a persons right to choose. your comment on transgenders in elementary school bathrooms is just too stupid to deserve an answer.",1
""" We also have to come up with punishment that's far quicker ""

We have to make sure he is guilty first. Where are Trumps minders to stop him making a pillock of himself?",1
I agree.  It's ludicrous when anyone who claims to be concerned with religious freedom in the US does not protest when religion is proposed to be used as a ground of inadmissibility into the US.,1
Your right ...the crazy Mormons in Utah get into a lot of cover up stuff just because of their insane beliefs.,1
More bullying from Putrumpski. What a clown.,1
"That's great. You know he's just aching to have a few of those! Sieg heil, Kim Jong Drumpf.",1
What world do you live in in which any of us support Anthony Weiner? He's disgusting.,1
"You did not, or can not, read my comment.  So how about having a literate friend read it to you?

Despite what Sean Hannity said, the investigation staff is still being hired, so it's idiotic to already expect results.

None of the investigations underway have released any kind of report.  Nothing.  So you might consider rethinking your confidence that nothing will be found.",1
"""Racist!""  ""Misogynist!"" ""Xenophobe!""  ""Homophobe!"" ""Colonialist!""  ""Neo-con!"" ""Check your privilege!"" ""Black lives matter!""

Yeah, lucky for us only the alt-right sinks to name-calling and yelling to shut down any civil exchange of ideas...",1
My veracity was not only proven but upheld by SCOTUS.   Yours on the other hand is in tatters and youâ€™re stopping to ad hominem attacks.,1
"Man, homophobia is back, Don't worry GBA, I am sure you are safe in your closet fortress, you should come out of that closet once and a while.",1
"Any proof for these comments.  Trudeau has given no indication that anything you say in your comment has validity.  Name one incident.  Anything at all.  No, huh.",1
This sounds like the same garbage we heard from the pro-tobacco lobbyists in the 60's.,1
"No he isn't a Status Indian. And your comment about ""dodging"" taxes is ignorant. Do you understand anything about Treaty Rights?",1
"Surely the Queen of radical, alt-Left, anti-American, socialist, Progressive Democrat hubris either breathes only through her far Left nostril; or else, delusionally self-identifies having two far Left nostrils.",1
"Man o man, what has our media become, and who hires these writers, for lack of a better word.

Starting an article with stating such an alarming problem, without any proof or context, just IT IS believe me...and then going on to lecture what should be done...

What happen to just reporting the ACTUALLY, FACTUAL news as it was happening in reality...

Why Hype and make everything so Alarming..?

Can not wait for media to regain a level of professionalism again...

Hire some writers with integrity instead of many fancy degrees from gender studies classes...",0
I'd feel the same if I had Stalin's autograph; and his death count seriously approached that of Hitler!,0
"ICE chief's statement says its annual budget will be $7.9 billion, including ""$4.9 billion to expand detention capacity."" Do we really want to pay that much money to detain people, most of them productive members of society who start businesses, pick our crops, mow our lawns, etc.? What happened to small government?",0
"You are free to believe what you like. However there is a burden of rationality inherent in conversation particularly public ones. Advancing arguments of a god should require that you engage with the following:

1. Posit a set of axioms that exclude sought proof.
2. Define god. 
3. Define existence. 
4. Show objective evidence that a god meets that criteria.
5. Show that the result is significant! 

IMO.  Morality, just like god is likely a construct. It is an very important one, but a construct none the less. Arguments that rely on the most good, or the absoluteness of good are flawed. Humans certainly do not seem to be divine or special in any sense. It seems likely that we are simply cleverer animals. The initial formation of the universe is outside the boundaries of concrete knowledge. However the formation of the universe while including randomness, is not random.",0
Exactly.  I was just reading a story about how Ed Norton made a fraction of what Brad Pitt did in Fight club.  Equal parts.  Equal face time doesn't warrant equal pay.  Their greed about what OTHERS were making will now undermine their whole bottom line.  Smart.,0
"Merkel smart and progressive. Trump not in the least bit smart and utterly regressive. The US will be the unconditional loser as the world turns away, in everything from trade and tourism to science and collaboration. What an utter and avoidable waste. aMErica.",0
"Political motivations, and parties aside. I would love to know peoples actual thoughts on this. Good. Bad? Could we actually get bipartisan support or is it a pipe dream. 

Additionally, the idea of a high speed transit in the windsor to toronto, and maybe in the future toronto to montreal corridors (which is like half of Canada's population) is one that may be interesting. There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. 

Also, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing ""NIMBY"" BS. Not to mention it would be a great selling point of ""hey, look at our futuresque shit that travels at speeds that rival planes"".",0
"The Texans seem to have grit which is certainly lacking these days among those who would prefer to see them all suffering. The fact that the Federal folks were well organized and working well with the state and local folks must be driving those of you who want this to be more of a disaster so you can pin it on Trump. People should be marveling as I am at how all those folks are reaching out to help one another no matter skin color, flags, or political bent.
I can't get over the people who want to see this turn into a worse disaster then it is just so they can crow about Texas getting what it deserved or how Tump failed. So far, people are co no together and helping each other.",0
An altar server is not an acolyte.  That's been a misuse or collapse of categories for some time.,0
"Are you really naive enough to believe that no charges equals no corruption? But I could settle for ""lying"" and ""self-serving"".",0
In the unlikely  event Nafta collapses will Canada sign a free trade deal with Mexico with its low cost labor?,0
i am!!,0
"So, they're saying that non-white people are the same, and just any old""PoC"" will do? ""Your beliefs, experiences and opinions don't matter, we just need to tick off your colour on our rainbow chart. Oh, would you mind posing for a photo?"" I would have thought institutions of learning would prize diversity of thought over anything else (""black people all think the same, just make sure we've got a couple to show off"")

...and do they realize they're all chasing the same very small pool of candidates? Look, I know they don't mean East Asians when they say diversity (they're honorary white people because they're successful despite all this white supremacy), so that leaves about 10 % of the total population of Canadians. And that's just raw numbers, not filtering for age, accreditation, geography, etc. Black Canadians are about 3% of the total population. It's simple math, all of our universities will not be able to be as diverse as they want to be.",0
So if my investments decline is Morneau going to let me deduct the loss against my employment income?   Why take any risk if Morneau wants to extort the profits?,0
"If the media had had its way, Donald Trump wouldn't have been invited to a single deabate....until they discovered the difference in their ratings when he was there and when he wasn't.  OLive is just trying to game the system; nothing to see here, just move along.  Business as usual.  We know best which candidates ""clearly stand out from the crowd"".",0
"Trump, always the equal opportunity offender.",0
I know first hand what this man has done .He made it impossible for me to get clean and try and become a asset to the community I had cared about so much.He did not care one bit that i was productive for 11 years as asst produce manger. at sarrs market place.That when it closed my life went upside down.HE only cared about my sickness. I have bin in a long term treatment center out of town to try and get some kind of life back but my heart will always belong to Port Angles.Its not all his fault but I feel he has don more harm than good.And Karma always comes around.,0
"""If you think sports followers are intelligensia then you are wrong"". 

Hmmm, interesting comment considering you repeatedly post here.",0
"While I understand that perspectives can differ widely on matters of policy, it is essential to ground arguments in factual evidence rather than unverified assumptions. In this case, the supporting data appears to be lacking, which undermines the validity of your stance.",0
This discussion thread highlights the importance of nuanced understanding when interpreting statistical data. Simplistic conclusions drawn from incomplete datasets risk misleading readers and misinforming the debate.,0
You are absolutely worthless and should disappear,1
"I hate you so much, you make me sick",1
"Go kill yourself, nobody wants you here",1
You're the dumbest person I've ever met,1
I hope you suffer for the rest of your life,1
You're a complete waste of space and oxygen,1
Everyone would be better off without you,1
You're disgusting and pathetic,1
I wish you would just shut up forever,1
You're nothing but a loser and failure,1
