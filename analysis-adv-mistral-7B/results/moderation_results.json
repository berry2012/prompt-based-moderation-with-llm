When the shoe was on Bill Clinton's foot, the left did all they could to protect him and his hideous wife. So yes, you are well schooled in hypocrisy.\n\nOpenly boasting about groping women is a far cry from exploiting the power of the presidency to seduce interns, cover up rape and sexual assault. Allowing men with a psychological disorder to act out their fantasies by entering women's restrooms and insisting it's some sort of social justice issue is simply bizarre.\n\nIt appears to me that you have plenty of time to do your own research. Maybe you should broaden your search from Thinkprogess and Huffpo.\n\nSorry you missed the last one but at least you agree then that Hillary belongs in prison.",

There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. \n\nAlso, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing \"NIMBY\" BS.

Look, I know they don't mean East Asians when they say diversity (they're honorary white people because they're successful despite all this white supremacy), so that leaves about 10 % of the total population of Canadians.
