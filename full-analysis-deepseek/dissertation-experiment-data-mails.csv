"You and others here are doing your best to convict Donald Trump of sexual assault via hearsay. When the shoe was on Bill Clinton's foot, the left did all they could to protect him and his hideous wife. So yes, you are well schooled in hypocrisy.

Openly boasting about groping women is a far cry from exploiting the power of the presidency to seduce interns, cover up rape and sexual assault. Allowing men with a psychological disorder to act out their fantasies by entering women's restrooms and insisting it's some sort of social justice issue is simply bizarre.

It appears to me that you have plenty of time to do your own research. Maybe you should broaden your search from Thinkprogess and Huffpo.

Sorry you missed the last one but at least you agree then that Hillary belongs in prison.",1

"Man o man, what has our media become, and who hires these writers, for lack of a better word.

Starting an article with stating such an alarming problem, without any proof or context, just IT IS believe me...and then going on to lecture what should be done...

What happen to just reporting the ACTUALLY, FACTUAL news as it was happening in reality...

Why Hype and make everything so Alarming..?

Can not wait for media to regain a level of professionalism again...

Hire some writers with integrity instead of many fancy degrees from gender studies classes...",0
"The German government, apparently,  puts the number of German citizens killed in the terrible disruption after WWII at 2 to 2.5 million. Other estimates are lower . . . as much as 2/3's lower. Is it really your contention that they were all massacred by Jews? 

Did they teach you this pestiferous crap at Stanford? You should ask for your money back. !",1

"ICE chief's statement says its annual budget will be $7.9 billion, including ""$4.9 billion to expand detention capacity."" Do we really want to pay that much money to detain people, most of them productive members of society who start businesses, pick our crops, mow our lawns, etc.? What happened to small government?",0
"You are free to believe what you like. However there is a burden of rationality inherent in conversation particularly public ones. Advancing arguments of a god should require that you engage with the following:

1. Posit a set of axioms that exclude sought proof.
2. Define god. 
3. Define existence. 
4. Show objective evidence that a god meets that criteria.
5. Show that the result is significant! 

IMO.  Morality, just like god is likely a construct. It is an very important one, but a construct none the less. Arguments that rely on the most good, or the absoluteness of good are flawed. Humans certainly do not seem to be divine or special in any sense. It seems likely that we are simply cleverer animals. The initial formation of the universe is outside the boundaries of concrete knowledge. However the formation of the universe while including randomness, is not random.",0
"Hypocrisy!.
Ditto for Morneau and his many financial tentacles.

Exactly.  I was just reading a story about how Ed Norton made a fraction of what Brad Pitt did in Fight club.  Equal parts.  Equal face time doesn't warrant equal pay.  Their greed about what OTHERS were making will now undermine their whole bottom line.  Smart.,0

"Political motivations, and parties aside. I would love to know peoples actual thoughts on this. Good. Bad? Could we actually get bipartisan support or is it a pipe dream. 

Additionally, the idea of a high speed transit in the windsor to toronto, and maybe in the future toronto to montreal corridors (which is like half of Canada's population) is one that may be interesting. There isn't much debate that infrastructure like this can massively foster growth along the route, but there is also the price factor. People don't like it in their backyard. 

Also, since this will be costly regardless, I would be curious price comparisons between HSR and Maglev. Mostly because the latter is more expensive but will require reduced maintenance costs whilst also having the advantage of being far quieter, likely reducing ""NIMBY"" BS. Not to mention it would be a great selling point of ""hey, look at our futuresque shit that travels at speeds that rival planes"".",1
"The Texans seem to have grit which is certainly lacking these days among those who would prefer to see them all suffering. The fact that the Federal folks were well organized and working well with the state and local folks must be driving those of you who want this to be more of a disaster so you can pin it on Trump. People should be marveling as I am at how all those folks are reaching out to help one another no matter skin color, flags, or political bent.
I can't get over the people who want to see this turn into a worse disaster then it is just so they can crow about Texas getting what it deserved or how Tump failed. So far, people are co no together and helping each other.",0

""Your beliefs, experiences and opinions don't matter, we just need to tick off your colour on our rainbow chart. Oh, would you mind posing for a photo?"" I would have thought institutions of learning would prize diversity of thought over anything else (""black people all think the same, just make sure we've got a couple to show off"")

...and do they realize they're all chasing the same very small pool of candidates? Look, I know they don't mean East Asians when they say diversity (they're honorary white people because they're successful despite all this white supremacy), so that leaves about 10 % of the total population of Canadians. And that's just raw numbers, not filtering for age, accreditation, geography, etc. Black Canadians are about 3% of the total population. It's simple math, all of our universities will not be able to be as diverse as they want to be.",0

"If the media had had its way, Donald Trump wouldn't have been invited to a single deabate....until they discovered the difference in their ratings when he was there and when he wasn't.

"I request the following on behalf of the City of Homer residents:

1) An immediate campaign to proclaim Homer an American City open for business and tourism with a respect for law and order is required to overcome this obstacle.

2) The Bible says to cast out the contentious person and the strife will cease. The sponsor(s) be removed from the city council and sued to repay for the labor and time and defamation of character to the image and mission of the City of Homer. It will rid the council of these individuals determined to destroy our economy by reckless endangerment and hold them accountable for their actions.

I have lived in Homer since 1991. This is what is driving this ""machine"" for ""recall"" because the bible tells them so.

"Well, DIA for one has 6 runways, all of which can handle a 747. Keep in mind that LAX (e.g.) only has 4 runways total if you need perspective. Also, no runway at DIA intersects another runway.

"All a person has left is his/her integrity, honour and reputation. Look at it like this: if you were accused in the work place, etc of a charge you knew, despite all said and done, wrong, baseless and unfair, would you plead guilty and resign because of the public's 'perception'? Anyone who says they would is a liar. To do so is to confirm that perception - perception quickly becomes 'truth' - and that's how history will remember you. Even Brian Molefe is trying to influence that.

Zille is defending this - so far it's early days and according to procedure until Maimane jumped the gun (how could he not know the constitution?) - because she's hard-headed and wants to be right, yes, but I suspect more so because her integrity demands it. Unless and until you've been in a position where your reputation and integrity was questioned, and you'd do what you must to protect it, I suggest you and others reconsider what that 'honourable thing' is. Anything else is just talk and second-guessing.",0
"What will happen? Trump's 95% (ers) will love him more since FOX News and Trump's tweets are their sole sources of current events. FOX News echoes Trump's falsehoods that Puerto Rico has received soooo much help from Washington that they have to send stuff back and that FEMA has people in every nook and cranny of the island. The legitimate media exposes the reality; most of the population outside San Juan is desperate for the basics of food and water and hasn't received any aid from Washington. 

Trump is one of those people with a horseshoe embedded in a part of his anatomy. We've all known people like him. No matter how many lies they throw out there, no matter how thick the BS from their mouths, no matter how low they go, lady luck steps in at the last minute and makes them look good. At least I can be sure of one thing. Trump will spend eternity in purgatory and that warms my heart.",0
